/* Programming Assignment 1: Exercise C
 *
 * Now we will learn how to effect the execution sequence of the various
 * processes.  We introduce a new system call (not present in Unix) called
 * Yield (pid), which causes the currently running process to yield to the
 * process whose identifier is pid.  Furthermore, when Yield (pid) returns,
 * it returns the identifier of the process that yielded to the one that is
 * now running (and returning from Yield (pid)).  This is illustrated by the
 * program below, which you should study and run.
 *
 * Questions
 *
 * 1. Can you explain the order of what gets printed based on the code?
 *
