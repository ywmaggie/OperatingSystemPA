/*	System calls
 *
 *	In general, a system call returns -1 if an error occurred (and thus, the
 *	system call failed), else a non-zero value whose interpretation depends on
 *	the particular system call.  For example, in the case of Yield (p), it
 *	returns -1 if an error occurs (e.g., bad process ID passed as *	parameter),
 *	or the process ID of the yielding process. For a more complex example,
 *	consider Fork (), which is used to create a process. It returns -1 if process
 *	creation failed, else it returns the process ID of the child to the parent,
 *	and 0 to the child (recall that Fork returns in both the parent and child
 *	processes).
