/* Programming Assignment 2: Exercise B (last modified 10/18/09)
 *
 * In this second set of exercises, you will learn about what mechanisms
 * are available to you to modify the kernel's scheduler.  Study the file
 * mykernel2.c.  It contains a rudimentary process table data structure,
 * "proctab[]", and a set of procedures THAT ARE CALLED BY OTHER PARTS OF
 * THE KERNEL (the source of which you don't have or require access to).
 * Your ability to modify the scheduler is via these procedures, and what
 * you choose to put in them.  You may also modify proctab, or create any
 * data structures you wish.  The only constraint is that you not
 * change the interfaces to these procedures, as the rest of the kernel
 * depends on them.  Also, your system must support up to MAXPROCS active
 * processes at any single point in time.  In fact, more than MAXPROCS
 * processes may be created (which you must allow), but for any created
 * beyond MAXPROCS, there will have been that same number that have exited
 * the system (i.e., so that only MAXPROCS processes are active at any
 * single point in time).
 *
 * Let's look at the procedures:
 *
 * InitSched () is called at system start-up time.  Here, the process table
 * is initialized (all the entries are marked invalid).  It also calls
 * SetTimer, which will be discussed in Exercise C.  Anything that you want
 * done before the system settles into its normal operation should be placed
 * in this procedure.
 *
 * StartingProc (int p) is called by the kernel when process p starts up.
 * Thus, whenever Fork is called by a process, which causes entry into the
 * kernel, StartingProc will be called from within the kernel with p, which
 * is the pid (process identifier) of the process being created.  Notice
 * how a free entry is found in the process table, and the pid is recorded.
 *
 * EndingProc (int p) is called by kernel when process p is ending.
 * Thus, whenever a process calls Exit (implicitly if there is no explicit
 * call), which causes entry into the kernel, EndingProc will be called from
 * within the kernel with the pid of the exiting process.  Notice how the
 * process table is updated.
 *
 * SchedProc () is called by the kernel when it needs a decision for which
 * process to run next.  It determines which scheduling policy is in effect
 * by calling the kernel function GetSchedPolicy, which will return one
 * of the following: ARBITRARY, FIFO, LIFO, ROUNDROBIN, and PROPORTIONAL
 * (these constants are defined in umix.h).  The scheduling policy can be
 * changed by calling the kernel function SetSchedPolicy which is called for
 * the first time in InitSched, which currently sets the policy to ARBITRARY.
 * SchedProc should return a pid, or 0 if there are no processes to run.
 * This is where you implement the various scheduling policies (in conjunction
 * with HandleTimerIntr).  The current code for SchedProc implements ARBITRARY,
 * which simply finds the first valid entry in the process table, and returns
 * it (and the kernel will run the corresponding process).
 *
 * HandleTimerIntr () will be discussed in the Exercise C, and should not be
 * modified in this part.
 *
 *
 * There are also procedures that are part of the kernel (but not in
 * mykernel2.c), which you may call from within the above procedures:
 *
 * DoSched () will cause the kernel to make a scheduling decision at the next
 * opportune time (at which point SchedProc will be called to determine which
 * process to select).  Elaborating on this further, when you write your code
 * for the above procedures (StartingProc, EndingProc, ...), there may be a
 * point where you would like to force the kernel into making a scheduling
 * decision regarding who should run next.  This is where you should call
 * DoSched, which tells the kernel to call SchedProc at the next opportune
 * time, i.e., as soon as the kernel determines it can do so.  Why at the
 * next opportune time?  Because other code, including the remaining code of
 * the procedure you are writing, may need to execute before the kernel is
 * ready to select a process to run.
 *
 * SetTimer (int t) and GetTimer () will be discussed in Exercise C.
 *
 * Finally, your system must support up to MAXPROCS (a constant defined in
 * sys.h) active processes at any single point in time.  In fact, more than
 * MAXPROCS processes may be created during the lifetime of the system (which
 * you must allow), but for any number created beyond MAXPROCS, there will
 * have been that same number (or more) that have exited the system (i.e.,
 * so that only MAXPROCS processes are active AT ANY SINGLE POINT IN TIME).
 *
 *
 * Exercises
 *
 * 1. Implement the FIFO scheduling policy, First In First Out.  This means
 * the order in which processes run (to completion) is the same as the order
 * in which they are created.  For the program below, the current scheduler
 * will print:  1111111111222222222244444444443333333333 (why this order?)
 * Under FIFO, it should print: 1111111111222222222233333333334444444444
 * (why this order?).
 *
 * 2. Implement the LIFO scheduling policy, Last In First Out.  This means
 * that as soon as a process is created, it should run to completion before
 * any existing process.  Under the LIFO scheduling policy, the program
 * below should print:  4444444444222222222233333333331111111111 (why
 * this order, and not 4444444444333333333322222222221111111111?).
