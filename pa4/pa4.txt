Programming Assignment 4  [Last Revision 11/10/13, 10:16pm]

Due 10:00pm Sunday, December 1



This programming assignment is on the topic of user-level threads, and
consists of 3 parts, A, B, and C.  Each part consists of a set of exercises
which you should do.

You will hand in ONE FILE: mythreads.c

Each of the programs below can be found in separate files, pa4a.c, pa4b.c,
and pa4c.c.

To install this assignment using your account on ieng9:

1. Log in to ieng9.ucsd.edu using your class account.

2. Enter in the command, "prep cs120f". This configures your account for this
class.	You should always do this when doing CSE120 work.

3. Enter in the command, "getprogram4". This will create a directory called
"pa4" and will copy the relevant files into that directory.

4. To compile, enter the command "make" (from within the pa4 directory). This
will compile all of the programs. You can compile a particular program by
specifying it as a parameter to make, e.g., "make pa4a".

5. To turn in the assignment, make sure that your mythreads.c file that you
need to turn in is in the current directory and type "turninprogram4".

Notes on grading

1. All you will be graded on is whether your code works, and how well it works
(is it efficient in time and/or space). You will not be graded specifically on
commenting/documentation. This doesn't mean you should not add comments as,
if the grader can't figure out what your code does, the comments will often
help. But, it's up to you.

2. Unless indicated otherwise, you should NOT use any library routines or
any code that you did not write yourself other than the routines given to
you.  For example, if you need a data structure like a linked list or queue,
you should create it yourself rather than relying on a C library.

3. You should NOT use dynamic memory allocation in your kernel.  For example,
you should not use malloc (both because it is a dynamic memory allocator, and
it is a C library routine which, as indicated above, you should not use).
Since any dynamic memory allocator may fail (if all the memory is used), the
kernel cannot depend on it (otherwise it might fail, which would be
catastrophic).

4. It is your responsibility to proactively come up with YOUR OWN tests that
you think are necessary to convince yourself that your kernel is doing what
is asked for in the specification. If your code passes tests provided by
anyone on the CSE 120 teaching staff, you should not assume that your code
"works" and you are done. What ultimately matters as far as what your code
is expected to do is the specification you are given. It is up to YOU to
interpret it and devise any test cases you think are applicable. This mimics
the experience of a real operating system designer/implementer, who has no
idea what kind of applications will be written for their operating system,
and how their code will be exercised. The real operating system implementer
must test for anything and everything, as best they can. So, you must test
robustly, and be creative in coming up with tests. You are free to ask
questions about cases that you think may matter, and even post tests you
think are worthy of sharing. In fact, we encourage this!

5. All your code must be contained in *** mythreads.c ***.
ALL OTHER CHANGES YOU MAKE TO ANY OTHER FILES WILL BE COMPLETELY IGNORED!
Consequently, do not put declarations, function or variable definitions,
defined constants, or anything else in other files that you expect to be
part of your solution.  We will compile your submitted code with our test
programs, and so your entire solution must be contained in what you submit.
If you code does not compile with our test programs because you made changes
to other files that required inclusion, YOU WILL RECEIVE ZERO CREDIT, so
please be careful!


/* Programming Assignment 4: Exercise A
 *
 * In this assignment, you will implement a user-level threads package.
 * Unlike the previous assignments, where you modified a portion of the
 * kernel, your threads package runs entirely at user level.
 *
 * In this first exercise, you will learn how to use some basic mechanisms
 * for building threads, specifically, the functions setjmp and longjmp.
 * These are standard C library functions that support "non-local jumps".
 * You can learn more about them by reading their man pages ("man setjmp"
 * and "man longjmp"), though you should be able to do this assignment
 * solely with the information provided here.
 *
 * setjmp (env) causes a process to save parts of its context in env, which
 * is a "jmp_buf" structure defined in <setjmp.h>.  (What is actually saved
 * in env is machine architecture and compiler dependent; examples include
 * the PC, SP, FP, return address, etc.  We need not be concerned with these
 * details here, though you may find these examples helpful to answer the
 * "challenge questions" below.)  setjmp (env) returns twice (similar to
 * Fork ()), returning 0 the first time, and a value other than 0 the second
 * time.  More on this below.
 *
 * longjmp (env, t) causes a process to do a non-local jump to the location
 * where setjmp (env) was called.  This is similar to a goto instruction,
 * except that it is non-local, i.e., transfer may be across previous
 * procedure calls that have not returned yet.  For example, given three
 * procedures A, B, and C, say setjmp (env) is called within A, and then
 * A calls B.  If B then calls C, and then longjmp (env, t) is called within
 * C, control returns to the point where setjmp (env) was previously called
 * by A.  Thus, the call stack is reduced because A then continues to run as
 * if B and C had returned (they are no longer pending).  This is because env
 * contains the stack pointer SP as it was when setjmp was called.
 *
 * It is VERY IMPORTANT to note that longjmp (env, t) can only jump into a
 * pending procedure that had called setjmp (env).  In our example, A called
 * setjmp (env) and THEN called B, which THEN called C, which THEN called
 * longjmp (env, t).  Note that A did not return before longjmp (env, t) was
 * called.  If A had called setjmp (env), but returned (to whatever called
 * it), a later call to longjmp (env, t) would generally not work properly
 * because the context described by env no longer exists; in particular,
 * the activation record for A is gone.
 *
 * To be more specific as to where control transfers after a call to
 * longjmp (env, t), it is to a location actually WITHIN the previous call
 * to setjmp (env).  Thus, setjmp (env) will return twice.  The first time
 * it returns, it had just set env and returns a value of 0.  When it returns
 * the second time as a result of calling longjmp (env, t), it (i.e., setjmp)
 * returns the value t.  By making t a number different from 0, the process
 * is able to distinguish whether this is the first or second return as well
 * as additonal information.
 *
 * An example will clarify the above discussion.  Study the program below.
 * To run the program, use the supplied Makefile and run make.
 *
 * Questions
 *
 * 1. Can you account for the output order: A: t=1, B: t=2, C: t=4, D: t=5?
 *
 * 2. Make the following minimal changes so that the order is ACBD rather
 * than ABCD: (a) change the test in the conditional to != rather than ==,
 * and (b) move the longjmp statement so that it is just after Point C.
 * Can you explain why the printed values of t are 1, 2, 2, 3?
 *
 * 3. Change the test in the conditional back to ==, and move the longjmp
 * statement to just after Point D.  Can you account for the process's
 * behavior?
 *
 * If you were able to answer the questions above, you now have a basic
 * understanding for how setjmp and longjmp works.  You may now proceed to
 * Exercise B, where you will build on this knowledge, and things will get
 * more difficult, and more interesting.  For those who want an additional
 * challenge (not necessary to complete the rest of the assignment), see
 * if you can answer the following optional questions.
 *
 * 4. Change back to the original setup (conditional test is ==, longjmp
 * is immediately after Point B).  Change setjmp to Setjmp and longjmp to
 * Longjmp.  What do Setjmp and Longjmp do?  When you run the program, you
 * should notice different behavior; why?  Hint: consider how the stack of
 * activation records changes over time.
 *
 * 5. Now change Setjmp to Setjmp1 and Longjmp to Longjmp1.  When you run
 * the program, do you notice any different behavior?  Can you explain why?
 * Hint: this behavior can only be justified by considering what must be
 * saved in (and restored from) env.

/* Programming Assignment 4: Exercise B
 *
 * We will now begin studying a simple user-level thread package.  You are
 * given the file mythreads.c, which contains a rudimentary threads package
 * that will only work for two threads.  It contains the following functions:
 *
 * MyInitThreads (): initializes the thread package.  Must be the first
 * function called by any user program that uses the thread package.
 *
 * MySpawnThread (func, param): spawns a new thread to execute func (param),
 * where func is a function with no return value and param is an integer
 * parameter.  However, the new thread does not begin executing until
 * another thread yields to it.
 *
 * MyYieldThread (t): causes the running thread to yield to thread t. Should
 * return the ID (integer identifier) of the thread that yielded to the
 * thread being given control, i.e., the one returning from its call to
 * MyYieldThread.  More on this below.
 *
 * MyGetThread (): returns the ID of the currently running thread.
 *
 * MySchedThread (): causes the running thread to simply give up the CPU and
 * allow another thread to be scheduled.  Selecting which thread to run is
 * determined in this procedure.  Note that the same thread may be chosen
 * (as will be the case if there are no other threads).
 *
 * MyExitThread () causes the currently running thread to exit.
 *
 * Let us study MySpawnThread and MyYieldThread, both of which contain some
 * preliminary code that you may use.  (Note that for the next part, you will
 * need to change some of this code in a significant way.  If you develop a
 * good understanding of how this preliminary code works, it will help you
 * immensely.)
 *
 * First, there is a very simple thread management table, thread[].  You
 * may add fields as needed.  The only existing field is to save a thread's
 * context (filled by setjmp, and later used by longjmp).
 *
 * Next, MySpawnThread (func, param) is what does the bulk of the work.
 * It first calls setjmp (thread[0].env), which saves the context of
 * thread 0.  Thread 0 already exists by default; it is the "Main" thread.
 * Hence it will be creating a new thread, thread 1 (thread IDs range
 * from 0 to MAXTHREADS-1, where MAXTHREADS is defined in mythreads.h).
 *
 * Each thread requires its own stack.  Here is perhaps the most interesting
 * part of the code, where we simply use the current stack (for this single
 * Umix process, which is currently being used by thread 0), and so there is
 * no need to actually allocate space.  However, to ensure that thread 0's
 * stack may grow and not bump into thread 1's stack, the top of the stack
 * is effectively extended automatically by declaring a local variable s[]
 * (a large "dummy" array, which is never actually used).
 *
 * Two additional automatic local variables are declared, f and p.  These
 * are used to store the passed parameters func and param, but note that
 * f and p are near the top of the stack whereas func and param are somewhere
 * below the "cushion" provided by s[].  The importance of this will become
 * more evident.
 *
 * Next, a check is made to ensure that the stack was indeed extended.
 * It may happen that an optimizing compiler will notice that s[] is not
 * being used, and therefore gets automatically removed.  Here, just by
 * referencing it in the conditional statement would avoid this problem.
 * But if this conditional were removed, the compiler would like remove
 * s[] also.  You should try developing an experiment to see if this
 * would happen, by testing the address of, say, p, with and without
 * the conditional.  Its address should not change, but if it does, it
 * would indicate the absence of s[] (especially if the address changed
 * by the size of s[], i.e., STACKSIZE).
 *
 * Now that the stack is properly set up, the bulk of the work that needs
 * to be done by MySpawnThread (func, param) is complete.  Thread 1 is
 * ready to run and execute func (param), but MySpawnThread stops short
 * of actually doing this at this point in the code.  Since this is the
 * point where we want thread 1 to begin executing whenever thread 0
 * yields to it in the future, the context is saved by calling setjmp,
 * this time supplying thread[1].env as a parameter.  Since a 0 is returned
 * the first time setjmp returns, the call to longjmp (thread[0].env, 1)
 * occurs.  Later, when longjmp (thread[1].env, 1) is called, thread 1
 * again return from this setjmp, but this time since the returned value
 * is 1, the body of the conditional does not execute.  Indeed, what
 * Thread 1 will do is execute func (param), as given by f and p.
 *
 * But what happens during the first return from setjmp, when a call is
 * made to longjmp (thread[0].env, 1)?  The last saved context for Thread
 * 0 was at the very beginning of the body of MySpawnThread, where
 * setjmp (thread[0].env) was called.  This now returns for a second
 * time, with a return value of 1 (the second parameter of longjmp), and
 * so the body of the conditional is skipped, and MySpawnThread returns.
 * Thread 0 has now successfully spawned Thread 1, and can now yield to
 * it.
 *
 * This brings us to MyYieldThread (t).  Here, the context of the calling
 * thread is saved.  Note that the code is currently hard-wired to work
 * with only two threads whose IDs must be 0 and 1.  So when Thread 0
 * calls MyYieldThread (1), then 1-t = 0 and so Thread 0's context is
 * saved in the call to setjmp (thread[1-t].env).  Since the return value
 * is 0, longjmp (thread[t].env, 1) is called.  And where does Thread 1
 * begin executing from?  Answer: wherever its context was last saved.
 * Finally, if MyYieldThread (0) is called by Thread 1, notice that the
 * roles are reversed.
 *
 * The problems with this code are twofold.  First, it assumes there are
 * only two threads.  Second, it assumes the calling thread always yields
 * to the other (when in fact, we must allow for the possibility that a
 * thread might yield to itself).  Hence, these issues need to be addressed.
 *
 * The code below is a simple program that creates two threads, Thread 0
 * which is created by default and Thread 1 which is created by
 * MySpawnThread.  Control is then passed back and forth by calls to
 * MyYieldThread.  Study this program carefully, and make sure you
 * understand how it interacts with the code in mythreads.c  Experiment
 * with it extensively.  (In fact, it is a good idea to make a copy so
 * that you can modify it at will and always retrieve a clean version.)
 *
 * Here are some things to try:
 *
 * 1. Try removing the dummy array s[STACKSIZE].  What happens to the
 * program's behavior?  Try difference sizes for STACKSIZE.
 *
 * 2. Try removing the automatic local variables f and p, and replace
 * the call to (*f) (p) with (*func) (param).  What happens to the
 * program's behavior?
 *
 * 3. How would you generalize the code for MyYieldThread (t)?
 * Implement your solution so that the program below continues to work
 * properly.  Make sure your code allows a thread to yield to itself.

/* Programming Assignment 4: Exercise C
 *
 * You are ready to begin building a user-level thread package.  Your task is
 * to implement the functions: MyInitThreads (), MySpawnThread (func, param),
 * MyYieldThread (t), MyGetThread (), MySchedThread (), and MyExitThread ().
 * They should work in a general way, supporting MAXTHREADS active threads.
 * Note that a program may spawn more than MAXTHREADS threads, as long as
 * no more than MAXTHREADS threads are active at any point in time.
 *
 * You are given a test program below.  It currently references thread
 * functions that are properly implemented, i.e., SpawnThread, YieldThread,
 * etc., which mirror the ones you are to implement.  Eventually, you
 * should replace all of them with reference to your functions by simply
 * prefixing each one with "My", e.g., "SpawnThread" becomes "MySpawnThread".
 * Note that you cannot mix your functions with the working ones, so you
 * must replace all of them.
 *
 * 
 * Some notes:
 *
 * 1. MyInitThreads () should initialize all your thread management data
 * structures.  Here is where you may wish to reserve stack space FOR THE
 * MAXIMUM NUMBER OF THREADS that may be active at any one time (MAXTHREADS).
 *
 * 2. MySpawnThread should return the ID of the thread just spawned (assuming
 * no errors).  In Exercise B, it was assumed the return value was 1 because it
 * could only spawn a single thread (with ID 1); this needs to be generalized
 * to any value between 0 and MAXTHREADS-1.  If there is an error, such as if
 * there are already MAXTHREADS active threads (and no more can be created
 * until one or more exit), MySpawnThread should simply return -1.
 * IMPORTANT: Threads IDs should be integers that are assigned in increasing
 * order.  The initial thread (that exists by default) is thread 0.  The first
 * time MySpawnThread is called, it should create thread 1, and each subsequent
 * (successful) call to MySpawnThread, regardless of which thread makes the
 * call, should assign IDs 2, 3, ... 9, i.e., up to and including MAXTHREADS-1
 * (for MAXTHREADS equal to 10 in this example).  Values should be reused
 * AFTER having reached MAXTHREADS-1, again starting from 0 and incrementing
 * by 1, but a value that is in use should be skipped over (and thus not
 * assigned to a new thread since it is already the ID of an active one).
 * The result is that each active thread will have a unique ID between 0 and
 * MAXTHREADS-1 inclusive.  Note the increasing order of assignment and
 * incrementing by 1 (this is very important, as our test programs will expect
 * this order of ID assignment).
 *
 * Here is an example for clarification: say MAXTHREADS = 10, and seven
 * threads are created: 0, 1, 2, ..., 6. Next, threads 2 and 5 exit. Next
 * four threads are created: 7, 8, 9, and 2. Since 0 and 1 still exist,
 * those IDs are skipped over. Next 0 and 3 exit. Next three threads are
 * created. Since the last ID assigned was 2, and since 3 is the next
 * available, the three threads are assigned the following IDs: 3, 5 and 0.
 *
 * 3. MyYieldThread (t) needs to be generalized so that any thread can yield
 * to any other thread, including itself.  Also, the ID of the calling thread
 * must be properly returned, or -1 if t is invalid.  To clarify this further,
 * consider a program of many threads, two of which are threads 3 and 7.
 *
 * Thread 3 contains the statement:
 *
 * x = MyYieldThread (7);	// causes thread 3 to yield to thread 7
 *
 * Thread 7 contains the statement:
 * 
 * x = MyYieldThread (t);	// causes thread 7 to yield to thread t
 *
 * Assume that at some point in the past, thread 7 had run and had executed
 * its yield statement as shown above.  To what it yields to is not shown
 * as it depends on the value of t.  If t equalled 3, then control would
 * have gone to thread 3.  If it were another value, another thread would
 * have gotten control.  Regardless, assume that thread 3 is now running,
 * and executes its yield statement as shown above.  At this point, control
 * is given to thread 7, which returns from its yield statement with x set
 * to 3 (because it was thread 3 that yielded to thread 7).  The value of
 * x that will be set in thread 3 when its yield statement returns will
 * depend on whatever other thread eventually yields to it.
 *
 * 4. MySchedThread () is similar to MyYieldThread, except that MySchedThread
 * determines which thread to yield to, rather than this being specified via
 * a parameter as in MyYieldThread.  MySchedThread does not return any value.
 * If MySchedThread is called and there is no thread to run, it should call
 * Exit () so that the Umix process properly completes.  
 *
 * 5. IMPORTANT: MySchedThread should implement the FIFO (first-in-first-out)
 * scheduling discipline.  Thus, if a thread calls MySchedThread, it should
 * be placed at the end of a queue, and whichever thread is at the front
 * should be selected for execution.  If a thread calls MyYieldThread (t),
 * then the calling thread should be placed at the end of the queue, and t
 * should be removed from the queue, regardless of its position, and treated
 * as if it were at the front, i.e., selected for execution and when it gives
 * up the CPU, it should go to the end of the queue.
 *
 * 6. MyExitThread () should cause the currently running thread to exit,
 * i.e., it should never run again, and its resources, such as its entry in
 * the thread table, should be reclaimed so that another thread may use them.
 * Finally, it should call MySchedThread () to pass control to another active
 * thread.
 * 
 * WHAT TO TURN IN
 *
 * You must turn in one file: mythreads.c, which contains your user-level
 * thread implementation.
 *
 * Your programs will be tested with various Main programs that will exercise
 * your threads implementation.  As always, make sure you do as much rigorous
 * testing yourself to be sure your implementations are robust.
 *
 * While this assignment may be conceptually difficult, it does not require
 * a large amount of code.  The solution is roughly 100 lines of C code
 * (which include some comments) more than the version of mythreads.c that
 * was given to you.
 *
 * Good luck!
